# MMM : Mapping socio-ecologic innovation

***MMM*** *is an initiative formed by more than 20 organizations within the fields of collective economies to collaborate on **Mapping Alternative Social and Ecologic Innovation**. Initiated in autumn 2013, followed by a kick off **Munich Mapping Meeting** in March 2014, weâ€™re now on our [Road to Degrowth](http://programme.leipzig.degrowth.org/en/degrowth2014/public/events/221).*

Collaborative efforts are thriving everywhere, but still lack visibility. Where cartographic visualizations exist, they are limited in scope, scattered and under-used. This process aims at collecting, linking and visualizing existing groups, projects and initiatives of the collaborative economy.
