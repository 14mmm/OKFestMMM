| Time | Slot | Description |
| ---: | :---: | --- |
| 10&nbsp;-&nbsp;13 | **Thinking MMM** | *Working groups* on Taxonomy, Self-Organization and the Mapping of existing Mappings. |
|  | *break* | |
| 14&nbsp;-&nbsp;15 | **Introducing MMM** | [**Jon Richter**](https://twitter.com/almereyda) giving an *Overview of the collective mapping process* and its compartiments. |
| 15&nbsp;-&nbsp;16 | **Contextualizing MMM** | [**Adrien Labaeye**](https://twitter.com/alabaeye) on *The role of digital commons in sustainability transitions*. |
| | *break* | |
| 16:30&nbsp;-&nbsp;18 | **Mapping MMM** | [**Orangotango**](http://orangotango.info/) doing a *Critical collective mapping workshop* of the process itself. |

&nbsp;

> This one-day session is conceived in three parts:
> 
> * an evaluation block that realigns [current activities of MMM](#Current_Activities) towards the [presentation at the Degrowth conference](http://programme.leipzig.degrowth.org/en/degrowth2014/public/events/221).
> * a presentation block that delivers **contextual framings for the public**.
> * a mapping workshop to exemplify the challenges of visualizing collaborative processes.

## Rationale

&nbsp;

The original motivation of the initiators is to unify stand-alone initiatives, minimize redundancies in public relations and to maximize the visibility of the alternative movement by creating a large and open visual knowledge resource about self-organization. It is crucial for the participants to ensure that this remains a non-profit effort that is owned and managed as a Commons.

We believe open maps have an extraordinary potential for visualizing and sharing knowledge and that they can be used as a lever for a bottom-up transition towards sustainability, beyond growth.

We are very excited to exchange around the idea with the Fest's crowd. Sustainably minded people, linked data aficionados as well as OSM contributors are encouraged to join us.

## Explanatory Diagrams

&nbsp;

In the prospect of finding early emergent patterns of self-organization, the MMM collective had to understand first its innerst dynamics,

## Current Activities

&nbsp;

Civil society has accumulated an impressive amount of hands-on knowledge of what could be more sustainable, more equitable alternatives to the current socio-economic system. This knowledge, though, is largely scattered, dispersed in silos. A unified mapping strategy leads to a visual and accessible tool for distributed communities to build a common narrative while retaining the complexity and diversity of local practices.

### Mapping existing Mappings

* How can we break up the data silos to map the diversity of the alternative economy ?

### Web Maps and Services

to assess the usability of the interface and aims at refining the design of this tool in a collaborative process, adressing in particular the challenge of interlinked data in the case of mapping.

### Mapping the Mapping of Mappings

### Research on social sustainability

## Open Knowledge Fest

&nbsp;

OuiShare Labs Hacks is a fringe event to the Open Knowledge Festival 2014 in Berlin. It is aimed at the production and organization of distributed networking tools for the common good.
