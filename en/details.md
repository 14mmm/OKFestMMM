## Rationale

The session is conceived as a mapping workshop to assess the usability of the interface and aims at refining the design of this tool in a collaborative process, adressing in particular the challenge of interlinked data in the case of mapping.

The motivation of the initiators is to unify stand-alone initiatives and to maximize the visibility of the alternative movement by creating a large and open knowledge resource. It is crucial for the participants to ensure that this remains a non-profit effort that is owned and managed as a Commons.

We believe open maps have an extraordinary potential for visualizing and sharing knowledge and that they can be used as a lever for a bottom-up transition towards sustainability, beyond growth. We are very excited to exchange around the idea with the Fest's crowd. 

Sustainably minded people, linked data aficionados as well as OSM contributors are encouraged to join us.

## Current Activities

&nbsp;

Civil society has accumulated an impressive amount of hands-on knowledge of what could be more sustainable, more equitable alternatives to the current socio-economic system. This knowledge, though, is largely scattered, dispersed in silos. A unified mapping strategy leads to a visual and accessible tool for distributed communities to build a common narrative while retaining the complexity and diversity of local practices.

### Mapping existing Mappings

* How can we break up the data silos to map the diversity of the alternative economy ?
