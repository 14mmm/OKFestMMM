## Programme

&nbsp;

| Time | Slot | Description |
| ---: | :---: | --- |
| 10&nbsp;-&nbsp;13 | **Thinking MMM** | *Working groups* on Taxonomy, Self-Organization and the Mapping of existing Mappings. |
|  | *break* | |
| 14&nbsp;-&nbsp;15 | **Introducing MMM** | [**Jon Richter**](https://twitter.com/almereyda) giving an *Overview of the collective mapping process* and its compartiments. |
| 15&nbsp;-&nbsp;16 | **Contextualizing MMM** | [**Adrien Labaeye**](https://twitter.com/alabaeye) on *The role of digital commons in sustainability transitions*. |
| | *break* | |
| 16:30&nbsp;-&nbsp;18 | **Mapping MMM** | [**Orangotango**](http://orangotango.info/) doing a *Critical collective mapping workshop* of the process itself. |

&nbsp;

> This one-day session is conceived in three parts:
> 
> * an *evaluation*&nbsp;&nbsp;block that realigns [current activities of MMM](#Current_Activities) towards the [presentation at the Degrowth conference](http://programme.leipzig.degrowth.org/en/degrowth2014/public/events/221).
> * a *presentation*&nbsp;&nbsp;block that delivers **contextual framings for the public**.
> * a *mapping*&nbsp;&nbsp;workshop to exemplify the challenges of visualizing collaborative processes.

## Rationale

&nbsp;

The original motivation of the initiators is to unify stand-alone initiatives, minimize redundancies in public relations and to **maximize the visibility of the alternative, the movement of movements** by creating a **large and open visual knowledge resource** about self-organization. It is crucial for the participants to ensure that this remains a non-profit effort **owned and governed as a Commons**.

We believe open maps have an extraordinary potential for **visualizing and sharing knowledge** and that they can be used as **a lever for a bottom-up transition** towards sustainability, *beyond* growth.

> We are very excited to exchange around the idea with the Fest's crowd.
*Sustainably minded people, linked data aficionados as well as OpenStreetMap (OSM) contributors are encouraged to join us.*

## Explanatory Diagrams

&nbsp;

In the prospect of finding early emergent patterns of self-organization, the MMM collective had to understand first its innerst dynamics, decide upon a self-organization model and create a division of labour framework. During this self-awareness phase, we were encouraged to create visual artefacts for explaining the sometimes confusing and specialized domains of our actions.

These early sketches try to deliver a slight impression of the foundational concepts and information flows that accompany such a distributed process.

### Technical Overview

&nbsp;

## Current Activities

&nbsp;

Civil society has accumulated an impressive amount of hands-on knowledge of what could be more sustainable, more equitable alternatives to the current socio-economic system. This knowledge, though, is largely scattered and dispersed in silos. For some like us, a unified mapping strategy leads to a visual and accessible tool. It builds a common narrative for distributed communities while retaining the complexity and diversity of local practices. 

&nbsp;

### Taxonomy Development

*Preparing a crowdsourced vocabulary on collective economies.*

Perspectives like those of *welfare economies*, *degrowth approaches*, *solidary economy*, *Shareconomy*&nbsp;&nbsp;or *commons-based peer production* (*cf.*&nbsp;&nbsp;[Boell.Thema 1/2014 : Seitenwechsel – Die Ökonomien des Gemeinsamen](http://www.boell.de/de/2014/05/21/boellthema-12014-seitenwechsel-die-oekonomien-des-gemeinsamen)) challenge us by inherently questionning the way *how we talk* about the collective organization of society.

Before we can supply [meaningful (meta)data](http://falkland-cms-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/taxonomy.html) to the global OpenStreetMap database, we will undergo their community process and officially propose [a draft of a socio-ecology taxonomy](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:KartenKarsten/futureMap) to their group decision process.

> Further on, the actual aim is to transform the collection into a linked data ontology that can be reused elsewhere than OpenStreetMap.

&nbsp;

### Mapping existing Mappings

*How can we break up the data silos to map the diversity of the alternative economy?*

When attempting [a comparative review of existing mapping initiatives](https://docs.google.com/a/getactive.org/spreadsheets/d/1gyqgHDoEj-w8LEdcPBs_J1FMtOf0GHFzZcHPtAQMorI/edit#gid=0), the process of structuring and refactoring knowledge (check the [cover image over at Trello](https://trello.com/c/0VGefbtl/11-taxonomiediskussion)) that is already out there asks for a dedicated research vector. Ideas and inspiration can be taken and derived from [thoroughly described action research](http://agspak.de/wissenwuchernlassen/) projects and data portals like [Open Knowledge Foundation's CKAN](http://ckan.org/) or [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/products/open-data-portal/).

Right now we try to create a simple visual interface for accessing the review's Google Drive Spreadsheet like a database and then start to think about more appropriate curation engines. [Falkland CMS](http://falkland-cms.com/) appears to be a proposing candidate, especially as it integrates with CouchDB that we have already chosen as metadata engine. A connection with [Metacademy](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/deep_belief_networks#focus=gvp31pbp&mode=explore) as the visualization engine can be a first intermediary milestone.

> Understanding previous appropriations of the field like [ESSglobal's interoperability guidelines](https://trello.com/c/zadwlD7s/10-vorschlag-von-ess-global-zum-datenaustausch) appears tremendously important to integrate with international research. First contemporary connections exist with the [Towards European Societal Sustainability](https://trello.com/c/KYqCoOA0/43-design-entwurf-der-forschungsplattform-tess-bitte-pdf-anschauen-und-kommentieren) (TESS) research project.

&nbsp;

### Web Maps and Services

*From interactive vizualizations to self-organization infrastructure.*

Any of the above endeavours relies on digital media. Most activities will be and are being documented with the help of online publishing systems. Due to the complexity of the overall process, a plethora of spezialized interfaces enables complementary access.

Therefore we have to assess the usability of the interfaces. Collaborative refining of the design process adresses in particular the challenge of interlinked data in the case of mapping. Underlying technologies are the [OpenStreetMap stack](http://www.mindmeister.com/de/399697910/openstreetmap-stack-visualisation-mind-map) and a [geographically enabled CouchDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prQiUgkgpYs) for additional metadata.

> If you are interested in a collaborative mapping methodology based on OpenStreetMap's technology, please feel especially invited to stop by. Any little piece of [Volunteered Geographic Information](http://www.floatingsheep.org/) (VGI) gathered will assist to create the algorithmic representations of collective economies.

## Tangential Support

### Mapping the Mapping of Mappings

The critical mapping collective [Orangotango](http://orangotango.info) will provide a workshop to map the mapping process itself. It will include central and peripheral networking done within

### Research on social sustainability

When establishing sustaining processes, new political contexts are created and stimulated. [Adrien Labaeye](http://transitionlab.wordpress.com/author/ecolopirate/) helps us understanding broader implications of [digital commons in sustainability transitions](http://transitionlab.wordpress.com/2014/05/07/research-in-focus-1-digital-commons-for-an-urban-transition-towards-sustainability/). He is also entrenched in the TESS (look above) activities.

## Open Knowledge Fest

&nbsp;

**Mapping MMM** is a fringe event to the **Open Knowledge Festival 2014** in Berlin. It is aimed at the *production and organization* of a **cartographic representation** of the *socio-ecologic multitude* for common good.
